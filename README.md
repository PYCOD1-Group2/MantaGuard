## 🚀 First Launch

### Prerequisites

#### System Requirements
- **Linux Operating System** (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 12+, or compatible distribution)
  - ⚠️ **Important**: MantaGuard requires Linux due to Zeek dependency limitations
  - Windows and macOS are not supported
- **Python 3.8+** (Python 3.9+ recommended)
- **Administrative privileges** (required for network packet capture and Zeek installation)
- **4GB+ RAM** recommended for optimal performance

#### Core Dependencies
- **Zeek Network Security Monitor** (formerly Bro)
  - Core component for network packet analysis and log generation
  - Must be installed before running MantaGuard
  - See [Zeek Installation Guide](#zeek-installation-guide) below if not installed
- **uv** package manager ([installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
  - Used for Python dependency management and virtual environments

### Quick Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PYCOD1-Group2/MantaGuard.git
cd MantaGuard

# 2. Initialize the project (installs dependencies and sets up environment)
./init.sh

# 3. Launch MantaGuard (starts server and opens browser)
./start.sh
```

That's it! MantaGuard will automatically open in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Manual Setup (Alternative)
If you prefer manual setup or the scripts don't work on your system:

```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment
uv venv

# 2. Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# OR
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
uv sync

# 4. Launch application
uv run python app.py
```

## 📦 Zeek Installation Guide

> **Note**: The `init.sh` script will automatically check for Zeek and offer to install it for you. This section is for manual installation or troubleshooting.

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)
The easiest way to install Zeek is to let MantaGuard handle it:
```bash
./init.sh  # Will detect missing Zeek and offer to install it
```

### Manual Installation

#### Ubuntu (20.04, 22.04, 24.04)

1. **Add Zeek Repository:**
```bash
# Add GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:zeek/xUbuntu_$(lsb_release -rs)/Release.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/security_zeek.gpg > /dev/null

# Add repository
echo "deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/zeek/xUbuntu_$(lsb_release -rs)/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/security:zeek.list
```

2. **Install Zeek:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y zeek
```

#### Debian 12

1. **Add Zeek Repository:**
```bash
# Add GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:zeek/Debian_12/Release.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/security_zeek.gpg > /dev/null

# Add repository
echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/zeek/Debian_12/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/security:zeek.list
```

2. **Install Zeek:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y zeek
```

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify Zeek is working:
```bash
# Check if Zeek is installed
zeek --version

# Check if zeekctl is available
zeekctl --help

# Test basic functionality
echo 'print "Hello from Zeek";' | zeek
```

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **"zeek: command not found"**
   - Zeek may be installed in `/opt/zeek/bin/`
   - Add to PATH: `export PATH="/opt/zeek/bin:$PATH"`
   - Or create symlinks: `sudo ln -s /opt/zeek/bin/zeek /usr/local/bin/zeek`

2. **Permission errors during installation**
   - Ensure you have sudo privileges
   - Some distributions may require additional repositories

3. **Repository key issues**
   - Try updating ca-certificates: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ca-certificates`
   - Manually verify GPG key import

## 🤖 Anomaly Detection (OCSVM)

### How the OCSVM Model Works

MantaGuard uses OneClassSVM for anomaly detection:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Network connections are converted to feature vectors
2. **Anomaly Detection**: OCSVM identifies connections that deviate from normal patterns
3. **Scoring**: Each connection receives an anomaly score
4. **Classification**: Connections are flagged as normal or anomalous

### Advanced Model Management

**Model Switching Capabilities:**
- **Multiple OCSVM Models**: Switch between different trained models
- **Model Versions**: Access different versions of trained models
- **Real-time Switching**: Change active models without system restart
- **Model Comparison**: Compare performance across different model versions

**Model Retraining:**
- **Manual Data Labeling**: Label connections directly from the interface
- **Incremental Training**: Retrain models with new labeled data
- **Training Data Management**: Organize and manage training datasets
- **Performance Validation**: Track model accuracy improvements

### Understanding Anomaly Scores

**Score Interpretation:**
- **< -0.5**: Highly anomalous (likely suspicious activity)
- **-0.5 to 0**: Moderately suspicious (requires investigation)
- **> 0**: Normal behavior (typical network activity)

**What the Model Detects:**
- Unusual connection patterns
- Abnormal data transfer volumes
- Suspicious timing patterns
- Atypical protocol usage
